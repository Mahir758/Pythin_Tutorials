These are all basic properties that I would have in most buildings.\n",

That would mean that MayerdoaEnterprises would be an instance of the Building class. Similarly, the building your friend is living in, BaaperdoaEnterprises, would be an instance an instance of the Building class. Both of these instances are called objects (not literally speaking). Both these objects would have the basic properties that the Building class has by default. The Building class was a blueprint that I could use to create these instances more easily instead of manually defining each and every building I create. We'll look more into this example later on."

Sure, different instances of our Human class may have different or the same coloured hair as Roshid Vy but Roshid Vy has black hair and will always have black hair until we change it because this is what we declare unique for him.

When you're creating a function like this inside of a class, they're called methods. Now why did I call it \"_ _ init _ _\"? I couldve easily called it \"initialize\" or just plain \"init\" if I wanted to keep things short right? Well the Pythonic convention for creating an initialization method is to name it \" _ _ init _ _\" . (There cannot be any spaces between the underscores, for some reason, I was not able to keep them without spaces, I apologize). The init method in python is always automatically called when an object is created. It initialises the object and sets up all the instance variabes.\n",

Anytime you create a method within a class in Python, the first parameter or arguement will always be \"self\" by default. Again its another Pythonic convention and you always have to write it. What does this \"self\" arguement actually mean? Well it doesnt really mean anything, its really just the name of object you created using the class.

    "Now the very first thing you may have noticed is the variables i declared inside the class. These are called class variables and they are called so because they cannot be accessed without referring to the class itself. If you try printing one_bed you will see that it isnt defined. Thats because it isnt defined in the program but its defined within the class.\n",

    "What makes class variables different from instance variables is that they are the same for every object. So if I were to create another HotelGuest object, the class variable for this object would be the same as the class variable for the \"guy\" object. But if we were to access the an instance variable such as self.f_name for the \"guy\" object, it may be different from the other object. This is because instance variables are specific to the instance or object itself."

    "That about concludes things. I have left out a few things for you to explore for yourself in object oriented programming such as class methods, static methods or decorated or dunder methods. I mainly left these out because I haven't found the need to use them and so I never really learnt about them. I'll save you guys the trouble and paste the YouTube link of where you can learn this stuff right here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc\n",
