We then told Python that as long as i is less than 5 to print \"Heylo frens im gonna be printed 5 times\". Then we told Python to add 1 to i. This is called incrementing. So we told Python to increment the variable i by 1. Then Python went back to the line that has \"while i < 5\" written and checked if i is less then 5. Since its still less than 5, it prints that line again and repeats what it did before until i is no long less than 5, but equal to 5."

This part of the code is pretty much saying within the range of 0 to an integer number that is less than 5. So z is first equal to 0 since thats where is starts from as stated in the range.

This is once again vital or our program won't run the way we would like it run. I'll give you a quick tip to remembering when to indent, after most of our commands (if, else, elif, while, for and in the future, def), you'll see that we write a collon ( : ). We should always make indentations in the next line of these commands, until we're done writing whatever we want until the end of the commands. Hopefully that came out easier than I thought\n",
