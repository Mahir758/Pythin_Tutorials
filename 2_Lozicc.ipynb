Two slices of bread, some peanut butter and jelly, right? What do you put between the slices of bread? Peanut butter and jelly. You can not put just peanut butter and call it a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Likewise, you cannot put just jelly and call it a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You would need both peanut butter AND jelly to make the sandwich.\n",

To obtain a \"True\" output from two inputs, you need the first input AND the second input to be true. In case of our peanut butter and jelly sandwich example, the sandwich is our output and we require that to be True so that we can get the actual sandwich. In order for that to happen we need both the peanut butter AND the jelly to be \"True\". "

Likewise, if we use just super glue and not hot glue, thats fine too, we can still get out model built. If we have both hot glue and super glue, thats good as well. We can get out structure built with the two of them. But if we have neither super glue, nor hot glue, we cannot get our model built.

But if both of our inputs are False, our output will also be False. From our anology above, we required the creation of our model to be True.

Since it isnt, it skips the \"print(\"yes it is\")\" line and goes to the elif statement. The elif part of the program is basically \"or else, if\".

So why not put another elif statement saying that if 2 is less than 3 then print, \"no, 2 is less than 3\"? Well we could do that and it would be correct. Or we can put in another statement, known as the else statement. The else statement is such that if all the previous conditions are not true, then do whatever is after the else statement. Its pretty much the \"or else\" part of the whole thing. Lets implement that in our above code."
